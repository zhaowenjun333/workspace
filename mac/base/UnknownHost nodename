java.net.UnknownHostException: MacCris: MacCris: nodename nor servname provided, or not known

To solve this:

Step 1 – Open the Terminal

Step 2 – Go to the host file

$ sudo nano /private/etc/hosts
Type your user password when prompted.

Step 3 – Edit the hosts file

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.0.1 MacCris
Of course you will replace MacCris with your hostname.

Step 4 – Save the hosts file

When done editing the hosts file, press Control+x to save the file.

Have fun !
